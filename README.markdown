# Black Shoes

Shoes for the browser, in CoffeeScript, without cream.

Currently, this is strictly for fiddling around.

## Getting Started

Try the [online demo](http://wasnotrice.github.com/shoes-black/).

## Hacking

You will need [Node](http://nodejs.org/), [npm](http://npmjs.org/), and  [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) installed. On OS X, try

    $ brew install node
    $ npm install -g coffee-script

Then, clone this repository, build the javascript, and run the demo
locally.

    $ cake build
    $ open index.html

## Goals

This is an experimental project. The goal is to see how closely we can
reproduce [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com) in a browser environment. There
are lots of benefits to targeting the browser, in terms of portability
and availability. It's worth a shot.

The current code does not aim to allow programming in Ruby, like regular
Shoes. Instead, it uses CoffeeScript, which might be close enough. Time
will tell. Got a Ruby implementation that runs in the browser? Let's try
it out!
